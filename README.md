# ManimRepo #
This repository is used to store my manim code.

## Gauss summation ##
This animation was created for my younger sister who is in primary school, so it involves very basic mathematical concepts. It is also my first attempt at making a video using Manim, so the code is quite rudimentary.

## Fireworks ##
This animation is a birthday gift for my sister. Was it too perfunctory?
